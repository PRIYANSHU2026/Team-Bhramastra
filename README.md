Coding project for Honeywell's Hackathon that converts point clouds to 3d meshes.


**Point Cloud to 3D Mesh Converter**  
A desktop application for 3D point cloud processing with surface reconstruction and multi-format export capabilities.  

---

**Key Features**  
- **User friendly GUI Interface**: File input dialog with format filtering  
- **Input Compatibility**: `.pcd`, `.xyz`, `.ply`, `.obj` files (also  `.e57` files with additional manipulation)
- **Processing Pipeline**:  
  1. Normal estimation with KD-tree optimization  
  2. Consistent normal orientation  
  3. Dual reconstruction engines:  
     - Poisson (adaptive depth)  
     - Ball Pivoting (radius auto-calibration)  
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive preview with rotation/zoom  
- **Multi-Format Export**: `.stl`, `.ply`, `.obj`
- **Higher Accessibility:** Improves range of devices by allowing preview to be saved in `.gif` format

**Workflow Process**  
1. Users select a point cloud file via the GUI  
2. System processes data with Open3D backend  
3. Live preview shows original cloud + reconstructed mesh  
4. The export panel offers format selection and save location 

**Technical Foundation**  
- Core Engine: Open3D for geometric processing  
- Visualization: Integrated 3D viewport with camera controls  
- Export System: Format conversion with vertex normal preservation  
- Cross-Platform: Works on Windows/macOS (path handling optimized)  

**Dependencies**  
- Open3D >= 0.17.0  
- NumPy  
- PyQt5 (GUI framework)  
- ImageIO (for future animation features)  

**I/O Specifications**

|**Input**|**Output**|  
|Point Clouds (.pcd/.xyz/.ply/.obj)|Meshes (.stl/.ply/.obj) and Image (.gif)|  

**Achievements with current solution:**  
1. Successfully executed conversion of point cloud file with approximately 6 lakh points (with considerable attention to detail)
2. Successfully made colored output files
3. Successfully added-on texture (from existing data in the source file)

**Future prospects:**  
- Implementation of an AI model to allow object detection within a given Point cloud file after processing
- Addition of voxel downsampling and/or advanced noise reduction 
- Implementation of Deep learning concepts to make a "one-size-fits-all" solution for increased robustness

**Cross-Platform Note**: While core functionality works universally, file dialogs/paths auto-adapt to OS conventions.
